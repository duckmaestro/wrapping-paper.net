    /// The PaperScope class represents the scope associated with a Paper 
    /// context. When working with PaperScript, these scopes are automatically 
    /// created for us, and through clever scoping the properties and methods 
    /// of the active scope seem to become part of the global scope.
    /// 
    /// When working with normal JavaScript code, PaperScope objects need to 
    /// be manually created and handled.
    /// 
    /// Paper classes can only be accessed through PaperScope objects. Thus in 
    /// PaperScript they are global, while in JavaScript, they are available 
    /// on the global paper object. For JavaScript you can use 
    /// paperScope.install(scope) to install the Paper classes and objects on 
    /// the global scope. Note that when working with more than one scope, 
    /// this still works for classes, but not for objects like 
    /// paperScope.project, since they are not updated in the injected scope 
    /// if scopes are switched.
    /// 
    /// The global paper object is simply a reference to the currently active 
    /// PaperScope.
